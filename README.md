## Program Description
This Python program, titled "Linguistic Analysis", is designed to analyze the frequency of each letter in a given text file. It prompts the user for a file name and outputs the frequency of each alphabet letter, regardless of case, as a percentage of the total number of letters in the file.

## Features

**Frequency Analysis:**
- Counts the frequency of each letter (a-z) in the text file.
- Ignores case to provide a case-insensitive analysis.

**Percentage Calculation:**
- Calculates the frequency of each letter as a percentage of the total number of letters.

**User Interaction:**
- Prompts the user to enter the name of the file to be analyzed.

**Modular Design:**
- The program is divided into functions for specific tasks: reading the file, computing frequencies, and printing results.

**External Function Import:**
- Utilizes `find_file` function from `assignment7` module to locate and open the file.

## Installation
